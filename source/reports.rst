Analysis and Reports
=====================

All reports in the system can be accessed via the Reports module on the left menu bar. For ease of generation, the reports have been grouped into four main categories;

1. Tabular Reports consisting of;

    * Birth Register
    * Immunization Register
    * Defaulters List
    * Defaulters List by Vaccines
    * SMS Reminders

2. MoH 710 Report
3. Vaccination Report
4. Timeliness Report

Note that when generating reports, the organization unit will be limited depending on your role and the County/Subcounty/Ward/Facility that you have been assigned.
