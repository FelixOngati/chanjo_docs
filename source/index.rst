The main objective of Chanjotrack project was to increase immunization coverage by sending reminders to mothers/guardians to bring their children to facilities for timely vaccination and by easing the process of tracing defaulters via an easy to use USSD service. 
Data capture at the facilities is done via an interactive USSD application whereas data analysis is done on the web platform that generates intuitive and informative reports. This manual focuses on training users on using the web platform.
